          # [Fix] Handle Username Uniqueness on Signup
          This migration updates the `create_profile_on_signup` function to be more resilient.
          It now handles cases where a chosen username already exists by appending a short,
          random suffix to ensure the username is unique. This prevents the signup process
          from failing due to a unique constraint violation.

          ## Query Description: 
          - This operation modifies a database function. It does not alter table structures or delete data.
          - It is a safe operation that improves the reliability of the user registration process.
          
          ## Metadata:
          - Schema-Category: "Structural"
          - Impact-Level: "Low"
          - Requires-Backup: false
          - Reversible: true (by reverting to the previous function definition)
          
          ## Structure Details:
          - Function affected: `public.create_profile_on_signup()`
          
          ## Security Implications:
          - RLS Status: Not applicable to this function.
          - Policy Changes: No
          - Auth Requirements: This function is a trigger called by Supabase Auth.
          
          ## Performance Impact:
          - This change adds a single, fast `EXISTS` check during user creation. The performance impact is negligible.
